## Technologies


| **Tech** | **Description** |
|----------|-------|---|
|  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)  |   Fast, composable client-side components.      |
|  [Redux](http://redux.js.org) |  Enforces unidirectional data flows and immutable, hot reloadable store. Supports time-travel debugging. Lean alternative to [Facebook's Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).|
|  [Babel](http://babeljs.io) |  Compiles ES6 to ES5. Enjoy the new version of JavaScript today.     |
| [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) | Bundles npm packages and our JS into a single file. Includes hot reloading via [react-transform-hmr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transform-hmr). |
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) | Automated tests with built-in expect assertions and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for DOM testing without a browser using Node.  |
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/)| Lint JS. Reports syntax and style issues. Using [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) for additional React specific linting rules. | |
| [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) | Compiled CSS styles with variables, functions, and more. |
|[npm Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)| Glues all this together in a handy automated build. |

3. You can start posting feedback form by filling form and submitting it.
4. All the fields are mandatory so make sure to fill all the details and correct email ID.
